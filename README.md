# dual_space_compressive_sensing

Dual space compressive sensing (DSCS) is an algorithm implemented for 4D-STEM dataset compression and compressive sensing.

## Requirements
numpy==1.21.5
scipy==1.10.1
scikit-image==0.19.2
matplotlib==3.2.2  

Newer or older version may work but can have decreption issues.  

## Citing DSCS  
If you find DSCS useful, please cite our article on Ultramicroscopy:
